## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (as the project uses Bun for package management and running scripts)
- A PostgreSQL database instance (either local or remote)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) (for containerized development/production)

### Installation & Setup (Local)

1. **Clone the repository (if you haven't already):**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bytebane/pharmpilot.git
    cd pharmpilot
    ```

2. **Set up environment variables:**
    Copy the example environment file to a new `.env` file:

    ```bash
    cp .example.env .env
    ```

    Now, open the newly created `.env` file and fill in the required environment variables, especially `DATABASE_URL` with your PostgreSQL connection string, and `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`. You'll also need `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` if you're using Vercel Blob for file storage.

3. **Install dependencies:**
    Using Bun, install the project dependencies:

    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

4. **Run database migrations:**
    Apply any pending database migrations to set up your schema:

    ```bash
    npx prisma migrate dev
    ```

    You might also want to seed your database with initial data (if a seed script is configured):

    ```bash
    npx prisma db seed
    ```

5. **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    bun dev
    ```

    This will typically start the Next.js development server on `http://localhost:3000`.

You should now be able to access the application in your browser at the specified local URL.

## üê≥ Docker-based Development & Production

You can run PharmPilot in Docker containers for both development and production using the provided `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`.

### 1. **Docker-based Development**

This mode enables hot-reloading and mounts your local code into the container.

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build -d
```

- The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
- Code changes on your host will reflect in the running container.
- Make sure your `.env.local` is set up for development.

### 2. **Docker-based Production**

This mode builds and runs the optimized production image.

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

- The app will be available at [http://localhost](http://localhost) or the configured domain.
- Make sure your `.env` is set up for production.

### 3. **Stopping Containers**

To stop all running containers:

```bash
docker compose down
```

To stop and remove volumes & orphans

```bash
docker compose down -v --remove-orphans
```

### 4. **Notes**

- The setup uses [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/) as a reverse proxy for production.
- Adjust the `traefik` configuration and domain labels in `docker-compose.yml` for your production environment.
- Database is **not** included in the compose file; ensure your `DATABASE_URL` points to a reachable PostgreSQL instance.
